# scala-quick

A summarized, quick-and-dirty getting started Scala guide based on Martin Odersky's "Programming in Scala"

## Goals

- make learning the fundamental features of Scala faster
- serve as a kind of refresher for the times one needs revision on these features
- as we know, teaching is the best way of learning, so I am hoping to get something out of this guide as well

## Who is it for

- the casual dev who wants to quickly dive into Scala
- especially useful for people with limited time as a resource

## Structure

- the structure follows Odersky's book
- there's some text describing what's happening and code that accompanies it or vice versa
